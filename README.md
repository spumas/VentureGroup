# VentureGroup

The main domain or hub for my sites reachable via the subdomains learning. and graphics. where I build share personal projects (the group itself being one too).

## Description

There isn't really an idea behind this domain, I only put access to my other sites onto it and make it look pretty.

## Current stage of this project

As of right now the plan is as follows:

- Add 3 buttons to provide a simple way of accessing the subdomains without having to type out the URL
